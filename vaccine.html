            The government is working tirelessly to provide vaccination to everyone.
            <br>
            Along with vaccines made in India,vaccines from other countries are also available.
            <br>
            It is important for people to know that vaccines do work,there is no reason
            for people to be afraid or doubt.
            <br>
            Some of the vaccines available in India are listed below:

            The CoviShield (Oxford/AstraZeneca formulation) vaccine, formerly known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 
            is made from a virus (ChAdOx1), a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus).
            In addition, genetic material has been added to the ChAdOx1 construct, 
            which is used to make proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus called Spike glycoprotein (S).

            Bharat Biotech's Covaxin (BBV152) is an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine that uses 
            adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II to boost immune response longer-lasting immunity. 
            The Indian Council of Medical Research created the Covaxin (BBV152) vaccine. 
            Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects, 
            says the U.S. CDC. The vaccine's adjuvant was developed with funding from the U.S. 
            National Institutes of Health has contributed to the success of the highly efficacious COVAXIN COVID-19 vaccine.

            Sputnik V is the world's first registered vaccine based on a well-studied human adenovirus vector platform. 
            It has been approved for use in 71 countries with a total population of 4 billion people.
            The Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is an adenoviral-based, 
            two-part vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Initially produced in Russia, 
            Sputnik V uses a weakened virus to deliver small parts of a pathogen and stimulate an immune response.

            The Moderna(SpikeVax COVID-19 Vaccine) The SpikeVax COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273, elasomeran) 
            is a Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus encoding for a
            prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein selected by Moderna Inc. in collaboration with 
            U.S. NIAID Vaccine Research Center investigators. The S protein complex is necessary for membrane fusion 
            and host cell infection.

            The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine(Johnson & Johnson (J&J))  (Ad26.COV2.S) is composed of a recombinant, 
            replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that, after entering human cells, 
            expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antigen without virus propagation. 
            An immune response elicited to the S antigen protects against COVIDâ€‘19.

            ZyCoV-D is India's first indigenously developed plasma DNA vaccine against COVID-19. In addition, 
            ZyCoV-D is the world's first Plasmid DNA Vaccine authorized for COVID-19.
            The ZyCoV-D vaccine was developed by Zydus Cadila using a non-replicating and non-integrating plasmid carrying 
            the novel coronavirus gene and approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct late-stage 
            clinical trials.
