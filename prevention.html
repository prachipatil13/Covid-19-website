            The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads primarily from person
            to person through respiratory droplets. This can happen when someone
            with the virus coughs, sneezes, sings or talks when close to others.
            By closely following a few safety measures, you can help protect
            yourself and others from getting sick.
            <br />
            It is important that we make sure the virus does not spread anymore.
            So do your part and follow the prevention methods.

            Wearing a mask is the best public health measure against the virus. It has
            been made mandatory in many places to wear a mask at all times when
            outside.
            <br>
            But it is also important to know how to properly use a mask:
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
              <li>Wash it everyday if it’s a fabric mask or dispose it in a trash bin if it’s a medical mask.</li>

            The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces 
            where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity.
            <br>
            Therefore it is important to maintain atleast a distance of 2 meters.
            <br>
            Make sure to follow these precautions:
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid close and crowded places.</li>
              <li>Try and meet people outdoors.Outdoor meetings are safer than indoor meetings.</li>
              <li>If you can’t avoid crowded or indoor places, take the precautions:
                <ul>
                  <li>Try and increase the ventilation in that place.</li>
                  <li>Wear a mask.</li>
                </ul>

            Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, especially:
          <ul>
            <li>After being in public places and touching door handles, shopping carts, elevator buttons or handrails.</li>
            <li> Before preparing food or eating.</li>
          </ul>
            If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
            Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.

            Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences – 
            the immune system – to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. After vaccination, if the body is later exposed to those disease-causing germs, 
            the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.
            <br>
            There are several safe and effective vaccines that prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19.
            <br>
            Some of the vaccines available in India are listed <a class="vaccine" href="vaccine.html">here</a>
